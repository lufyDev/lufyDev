🚀 I am a web developer comfortable around both front-end and back-end coding languages, responsive frameworks, databases, and best code practices. I have built web and mobile applications using technologies like `React`, `React-Native`, `Expo`, `Redux`, `NodeJS`, `JavaScript`, `Typescript`, `Tailwind`, and I have working knowledge of database platforms like `MongoDB`. 

🚀 My aim is simply to be the best software developer that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do. I am dedicated to perfecting my craft by learning continuously. I am a team player with a knack for visual design. I am currently using MERN stack to build applications.
